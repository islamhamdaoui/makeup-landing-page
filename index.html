    <h3>Great coverage</h3>
    <p>I used the color match tool with my phone. The color was perfect. I’m Carmel complexion. I was wearing Lancôme but when the color numbers changed I have not found my color again. I don’t live near a merchant that carries brands for me to try. I’m grateful I received this on the first try. I’d order again. A little goes a long way and it’s buildable. Hold up in 100F with humidity. I have combination skin. I’m 55 years old.</p>

    <h3>For my brown girlies</h3>
    <p>If you are brown then girl you already know the struggle. Finding the perfect shade has always been difficult through my life until Fenty came out and girl I’ve never looked back. This brand has definitely got all the shades covered even their undertone. If you have a hard time finding your shade, like a light coverage, and like to play it natural or add more coverage, then this is definitely your go to girl!</p>
